# Week 2 - Python

This week, you’ll step into the real world of coding with Python — the most loved and beginner-friendly programming language used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Automation.

You’ll not only learn the commands — but also understand the logic and mindset behind writing clean, smart, and powerful code.

 ✅ What You’ll Learn:

 - How to set up your Python environment using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
 - Writing your first program – from print statements to input handling
 - Understanding variables, data types, and control structures like if-else and loops
 - The secret of writing efficient code – indentation, logic flow, and clarity
 - Then jump into functions, classes, and OOP concepts
 - How to think like a programmer and build problem-solving habits
 - Practice through assignments and small challenges to make you confident
 - Strengthening understanding through MCQs, exercises, and agent-based case studies

✅ By the End of This Week:

- You’ll be able to write and run Python programs confidently
- You’ll understand how logic flows inside a program
- You’ll be comfortable using Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda
- You’ll have completed your first real coding assignments — your first step as an AI developer

 ✨In the upcoming modules, you’ll move from writing Python code to building real AI and Machine Learning models that learn from data.
